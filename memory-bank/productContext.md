# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
IELTS preparation requires practice with high-quality examples. Students need:
- Model answers appropriate for their target band score
- Understanding of advanced vocabulary and structures
- Clear explanations in their native language (Vietnamese)

## Problems It Solves
1. **Lack of personalized feedback**: Students can't always get expert feedback on their speaking answers
2. **Difficulty finding band-appropriate examples**: Hard to find answers that match specific band requirements
3. **Vocabulary and structure learning**: Students need to understand which words/structures impress examiners
4. **Language barrier**: Vietnamese students benefit from Vietnamese explanations

## How It Should Work
1. User enters a speaking question
2. Selects the appropriate part (1, 2, or 3)
3. Chooses target band scores (can select multiple)
4. AI generates a high-quality answer with:
   - Natural, fluent English appropriate for selected bands
   - Advanced vocabulary highlighted in the text
   - Sophisticated grammatical structures highlighted
   - Separate lists with Vietnamese translations/explanations

## User Experience Goals
- Simple, intuitive interface
- Fast response times
- Clear visual distinction between vocabulary and structures
- Easy to understand format for learning
